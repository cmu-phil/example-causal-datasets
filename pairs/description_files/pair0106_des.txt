Information for pair0106:

Speed of an electric toy locomotive


This is from an experiment where an electric toy locomotive (Maerklin) passes one round at different speeds, controlled by varyring voltage.
The time required by the locomotive has been measured by a pair of light barriers.  The voltage has been varied by manually changing the control knob
of a transformer and measured by the analog input of an Arduino after sending the electric AC voltage through a rectifier.  

First column (x): time required for passing one round   

Second column (y): electric voltage 


The measurement has been performed by D. Janzing in February 2017.
