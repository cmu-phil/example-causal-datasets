Information for pair0097

initial and final speed of a ball on a ball track for children

The data has been recorded by Dominik Janzing using a ball track that has been equipped with two pairs of light barriers. The first pair measures the initial speed
 and the second pair the speed of a ball at some later position of the track. The units of the speeds are arbitrary and differ for both measurements (X and Y) since they are obtained by
inverting the time the ball needed to pass the distance between two light barriers of one pair. 
 
 The initial part of the track 
has large slope. The initial speed is strongly determined by the exact position where the ball is put on the track. For part of the runs, the position of the ball has been chosen by D. Janzing, the other part by a 4-year old child. This should avoid that the variation of the initial position is done in a too systematic way.
