Information for pair 108:

This pair shows the dependence of the inverse velocity and the temperature of the heat bath of a Striling engine. The engine is
driven by a cup of hot water that is put underneath.
The inverse velocity is measured by the time needed for the engine's wheel for 1/6 rotation (because the wheel has 6 radius arms). 
The temperature is measured by a sensor that was put into the cup. 



First column (x): time for 1/6 rotation

Second column (y): temperature in Degree Celsius
